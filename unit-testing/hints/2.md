You can verify that a beer was created with the correct field by doing:

    verify(database, times(1)).create(eq(new BeerEntity(12L, "Stella", 3.50, 4.9)));

You can check that an exception was thrown by using:

    assertThatExceptionOfType(BeerAlreadyExistsException.class).isThrownBy(() -> beerService.createBeer(stella));
